In the distributed control package archive `control-x.y.z.tar.gz`, this directory contains the license of the [SLICOT-Reference library](https://github.com/SLICOT/SLICOT-Reference), which is used by the control package. The  SLICOT files are available under the  *BSD 3-Clause License* which can be found in the file `LICENSE` in this directory or [in the SLICOT repository](https://github.com/SLICOT/SLICOT-Reference/blob/main/LICENSE).

The original slicot `README.md` is available as `README-SLICOT.md` or [in the SLICOT repository](https://github.com/SLICOT/SLICOT-Reference/blob/main/README.md) as well.

If you encounter any bugs in the octave control package, please
DON'T bother the great people behind SLICOT. Most likely it's a
problem of the control package, not the proven SLICOT library.
Therefore, please send any reports to the [Octave bug tracker](https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/octave/) or the 
[Octave discourse platform](https://octave.discourse.group/).

**Note**: The file `TG04BX.f` does not belong to SLICOT. It is a slightly extended version of the original SLICOT file `TB04BX.f`. The extension allows to handle descriptor system with `E` not being the identity matrix. The original SLICOT file is included as `TB04BX.f.orig`
